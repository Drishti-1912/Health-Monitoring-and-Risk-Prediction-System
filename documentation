#Automated Healthcare Risk Prediction and Monitoring System
  
##Overview
The Automated Healthcare Risk Prediction and Monitoring System is an AI-powered platform that predicts and monitors healthcare risks in real-time.
It integrates data from wearable devices, medical records, and lifestyle factors to provide accurate health risk predictions, personalized recommendations, and alerts. 
The goal of this project is to improve preventive healthcare management and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.
  
##Features
Real-time Health Monitoring: Collect and analyze data from wearables and health records to provide instant health insights.
Risk Prediction: Predict risks such as heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension using machine learning models.
Personalized Recommendations: Offer customized lifestyle recommendations to reduce health risks.
Alerts and Notifications: Send real-time alerts when a risk is detected based on the health data.
Automated Reporting: Generate automated health reports summarizing risk levels and improvement suggestions.
Dashboard: A web-based dashboard to visualize health data, trends, and risks.

##Installation
To run this project locally, follow the instructions below.
  
##Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or above
Required libraries (listed below)

##Steps
1.Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutomatedHealthcareRiskPrediction.git
cd AutomatedHealthcareRiskPrediction
2.Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Set up the API keys (for fetching data from wearables):

Create an account with Fitbit or any other wearable service provider.
Obtain API keys and set them in the .env file.
4.Run the project:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
  
##Usage
1.Data Collection: The system collects real-time data from wearable devices such as Fitbit, Apple Watch, and medical records from public health datasets. You can integrate your wearable device API to fetch real-time data.

2.Risk Prediction: The system uses machine learning models to analyze the data and predict health risks based on patterns and historical data. You can specify the risk prediction model to use by modifying the config.py.

3.View Dashboard: After running the system, you can view the health data and risk predictions on the dashboard available at http://localhost:5000.

##Example Code Snippet for Data Collection:
import requests
// Fetch data from the Fitbit API
def fetch_data_from_fitbit():
    url = 'https://api.fitbit.com/1/user/-/activities/date/today.json'
    headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    data = response.json()
    return data
      
##Example Code Snippet for Prediction:
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
// Train a model to predict risk
def train_model(training_data):
    X = training_data.drop('risk_label', axis=1)
    y = training_data['risk_label']
    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    model.fit(X, y)
    return model

#Models Used
1. Random Forest:
Used for classification tasks to predict the health risk (e.g., predicting risk levels for heart disease, diabetes).
2. Logistic Regression:
A simple yet effective model for predicting binary outcomes like "High Risk" or "Low Risk" for specific diseases.
3. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
Used for time-series predictions, particularly useful in monitoring real-time health data over a period.
4. Gradient Boosting:
An ensemble model for improving prediction accuracy by combining the outputs of weak learners.

#Data Sources
Wearable Devices: Fitbit, Apple Watch, and other health-tracking devices (e.g., heart rate, activity levels).
Public Health Datasets: Datasets from sources like Kaggle, including heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension data.
Behavioral Data: Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns.
##Example Data
Fitbit Data: Heart rate, steps taken, calories burned.
Public Health Datasets: Medical records such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels.
