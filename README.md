# Health Monitoring and Risk Prediction System

## Project Overview
This project is designed to predict health risks in real-time using wearable devices, medical records, and behavioral data. The system leverages machine learning models to analyze data such as heart rate, activity levels, and lifestyle habits to provide health risk predictions, personalized alerts, and recommendations. Additionally, a dashboard visualizes this information in real time, and automated reports are generated periodically.

## Features
- **Real-Time Risk Prediction**: Predicts health risks such as heart disease, diabetes, etc., using ML models.
- **Data Ingestion**: Integrates data from various sources such as wearables (eg.Fitbit), medical records, and behavioral data (exercise, diet).
- **Personalized Alerts**: Sends alerts when a health risk is detected.
- **Data Visualization Dashboard**: Visualizes health data and predictions via an interactive dashboard.
- **Automated Reporting**: Generates and sends periodic reports on health metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models
  - `keras`: For deep learning models (LSTM)
  - `dash` / `streamlit`: For building the dashboard
  - `requests`: For API data collection
  - `matplotlib`: For visualizations
- **Database**: SQLite (for storing health records)
- **Tools**: GitHub for version control, Docker for containerization, Travis CI for continuous integration.
